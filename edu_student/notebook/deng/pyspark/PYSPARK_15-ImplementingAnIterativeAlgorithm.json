For example:</p>\n<pre><code>(1, ((37.43210, -121.48502), 1))\n(4, ((33.11310, -111.33201), 1))\n(0, ((39.36351, -119.40003), 1))\n(1, ((40.00019, -116.44829), 1))\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>b.</strong> Reduce the result: for each center in the kPoints array, sum the latitudes and\n<br  />longitudes, respectively, of all the points closest to that center, and also find the\n<br  />number of closest points.
