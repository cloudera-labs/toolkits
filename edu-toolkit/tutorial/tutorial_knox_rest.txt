ADMIN URL

curl -iku admin:admin-password {GatewayAPI}/topologies/admin -H Accept:application/json

LDAP
The current release of Knox ships with an authentication provider based on the Apache Shiro project and is initially configured for BASIC authentication against an LDAP store. This has been specifically tested against Apache Directory Server and Active Directory.

MASTER SECRET
The master secret is required to start the server. This secret is used to access secured artifacts by the gateway instance. By default, the keystores, trust stores, and credential stores are all protected with the master secret. 

The values for {gateway-host}, {gateway-port}, {gateway-path} are provided via the gateway configuration file (i.e. {GATEWAY_HOME}/conf/gateway-site.xml).

The value for {cluster-name} is derived from the file name of the cluster topology descriptor (e.g. {GATEWAY_HOME}/deployments/{cluster-name}.xml).

The value for {webhdfs-host}, {webhcat-host}, {oozie-host}, {hbase-host} and {hive-host} are provided via the cluster topology descriptor (e.g. {GATEWAY_HOME}/conf/topologies/{cluster-name}.xml).
