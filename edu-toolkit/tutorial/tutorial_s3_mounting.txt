1.- Download the latest version of s3fs (which is a FUSE backend for S3) from http://code.google.com/p/s3fs/downloads/list
wget http://s3fs.googlecode.com/files/s3fs-r177-source.tar.gz

2.- Unpack it:
tar zxf s3fs-r177-source.tar.gz

3.- Install dependencies for building. In my Ubuntu AMI was:
apt-get install build-essential libxml2-dev libfuse-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev

4.- Build and install the code (this copies the binary s3fs to /usr/bin):
cd s3fs; make install

5.- Edit a config file for storing your keys (you can check them out under AWS Menu -> Your Account -> Security Credentials)
touch /etc/passwd-s3fs && chmod 640 /etc/passwd-s3fs && echo &#39;AccessKey:SecretKey&#39; > /etc/passwd-s3fs
If you dont want to leave any trace of your secret key in your shell history, use a text editor to edit the file rather than echoing it.

6.- Create a directory for mounting the S3 filesystem and mount it. Note that you can mount the s3fs anywhere you like:
/usr/bin/s3fs bucketname /mnt/mountpoint

7.- Check it is woking correctly:
grep s3fs /etc/mtab

set the ACL on the bucket to allow Read Only for the datasets and scripts
