Purpose: This provides the tasks to be completed to create signed
certificates in support of generating the keys for HDP.

GENERATE A PCKS12 File
1. Login into the Microsoft Certificate Authority.
2. From the top, expand Certificates (Local Computer)
3. Expand the Personal folder
4. Click on the Certificates sub-folder
5. Locate the SSL certificate in the list on the right
6. Right-click on the certificate and select All Tasks > Export.
7. Select "Yes, Export the private key"
8. Click Next
9. In the Export File Format window, ensure the option for "Personal Information Exchange  - PKCS#12 (.pfx)" is selected

13. Click Next
14. Click Next
14. Browse to the location where the pfx file should be saved. 
15. Enter a name for the file. In our case we are using "cloudair.lan".
16. Click Next
17. Read the summary and verify that the information is correct.
18. Click Finish
19. Transfer the p12 file to the ssl directory for the certificates. 

EXTRACT THE CERT FILES
1. The generate script requires all of these files in the certificates directory.

2. Change into the certs directory.

	% cd <path>/certs

3. This command extracts the certificate in a .pem format. We are going to identify it as the .cer file.

	% openssl pkcs12 -in cloudair-ca.p12 -out cloudair.lan.cer

4. This command converts the pem file into a x509 binary der format. 

	% openssl x509 -outform der -in cloudair.lan.pem -out cloudair.lan.der

5. This command extracts the private key:

	% openssl pkcs12 -in cloudair-ca.p12 -out cloudair.lan.key -nodes -nocerts
